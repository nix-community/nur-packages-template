# Kuro's Devlog
Here is the devlog for the warnings that were previously shown on the main page

## 18/01/2022

Since both of Ao's repos are no longer maintained (both by [pythonRelay](https://github.com/pythonInRelay/ao) & the [original](https://github.com/klaussinani/ao)). I decided to fork the latest working version of Ao and rebrand it into something that can actually be pushed the app stores in the Linux ecosystems.

I've fixed a few visual bugs and am working on a re-brand of Ao into Kuro. I'll change the logo and some more stuff inside the app.
## Latest Update 26/01/2022
Released the first working version of Kuro (8.0.0). This was tested on Ubuntu 21.04 and seems to be working as expected.
Please provide feedback on the [issues](https://github.com/davidsmorais/kuro/issues) page ðŸš€
