      A simple wrapper around Ghostscript to shrink PDFs (as in reduce
      filesize) under Linux. Inspired by some code I found in an OpenOffice
      Python script (I think). The script feeds a PDF through Ghostscript,
      which performs lossy recompression by such methods as downsampling the
      images to 72dpi.  The result should be (but not always is) a much smaller
      file.
